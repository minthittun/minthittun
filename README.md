### Hi there 👋

I’m a software engineer and tech entrepreneur with over 10 years of experience building scalable systems, leading engineering teams, and driving product innovation. I specialize in full-stack development, particularly with MERN, .NET, Django, and Node.js, and enjoy designing clean, maintainable architectures that support long-term growth.

Throughout my career, I’ve led technical teams, shipped complex applications, and explored emerging technologies like AI, IoT, and WebRTC. My work bridges hands-on coding with system design and strategic thinking. I thrive in startup environments, where building from the ground up, solving real problems, and delivering value fast is key.

What I bring:
- Deep technical knowledge (MERN, .NET, Django, Node.js)
- Clean architecture & scalable system design
- Startup & product-building experience
- Team leadership & mentoring
- Continuous learning & problem-solving mindset

I’m always excited to collaborate on impactful projects and connect with others in tech who value innovation, efficiency, and great engineering.
